# 🧹 Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


## 📌 Project Description

In this project, I worked with the **Titanic dataset** to perform thorough **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. The goal was to prepare the dataset for modeling and derive insights from the passenger data using various visualization techniques.

This task served as a foundation for building predictive models by ensuring the dataset is clean, consistent, and well-understood.

## 🔗 Dataset

**Titanic Survival Dataset**  
- `train.csv` – Training data including features and survival status  
- `test.csv` – Test data for prediction  
- `gender_submission.csv` – Example submission file  

Additional visualizations saved as `.png`:
- `age_distribution_by_survival.png`
- `distribution_of_survival.png`
- `pairplot_survived.png`
- `survival_by_gender.png`
- `survival_by_pclass.png`

## ✅ Key Tasks Performed

- 🔹 **Data Cleaning**
  - Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, etc.)
  - Removed duplicate entries (if any)
  - Converted categorical data into appropriate formats

- 🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Analyzed relationships between `Survived` and variables such as `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Age`
  - Visualized data using:
    - **Histograms** to understand distribution
    - **Boxplots** to analyze spread & outliers
    - **Pairplots** for multivariate analysis
    - **Bar charts** for category-wise survival comparison

## 📊 Output Highlights

- ✅ Found higher survival rates among females and passengers in 1st class  
- ✅ Identified key features like `Sex`, `Age`, and `Pclass` that correlate with survival  
- ✅ Dataset is now cleaned and ready for machine learning models
