# 🧹 Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📁 Project Overview

This project involves **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns, clean the data, and prepare it for predictive modeling.

Key objectives:
- Clean and preprocess real-world data
- Identify missing and inconsistent values
- Explore relationships between variables such as `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, and `Age`
- Visualize insights with charts and statistical plots

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset used is the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), which contains details of passengers aboard the Titanic.

Files included:
- `train.csv` – Training dataset with survival outcomes
- `test.csv` – Test dataset without survival outcomes
- `gender_submission.csv` – Sample submission for Kaggle
- `.png` files – Visualizations created using EDA

---

## 📊 Visualizations

📷 Sample plots generated during EDA:
- `age_distribution_by_survival.png`
- `distribution_of_survival.png`
- `pairplot_survived.png`
- `survival_by_gender.png`
- `survival_by_pclass.png`

These help in visualizing:
- Survival rate distribution
- Class and gender impact on survival
- Age distribution among survivors and non-survivors

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python
- 📚 Pandas
- 📊 Matplotlib
- 🌈 Seaborn
- 💻 Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

---

## ⚙️ Features Implemented

- ✅ Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
- ✅ Converted categorical data for better visualization
- ✅ Removed duplicates
- ✅ Created statistical plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- ✅ Cleaned dataset ready for model training

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open in VS Code  
3. Run `titanic.py` or open Jupyter Notebook if preferred  
4. Ensure required libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`) are installed

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
